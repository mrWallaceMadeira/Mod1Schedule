# Intro to Computer Science

### Course objectives
As outlined in my [sales pitch](https://github.com/mrWallaceMadeira/SalesPitch) to you all, the goal of this class is two-fold:
  1. Improve your understanding and comfort with technology, computers and coding
  2. Learn to write Java code along the way

### Daily view
###### Before class
  - [x] Read the lesson and watch the linked videos (if applicable)
  - [x] Prepare questions 
###### During class (B Block, 10:45AM - 12PM Eastern)
  - [x] I'll set up a Teams meeting to write code, ask questions and collaborate
  - [x] Serves as time to work on labs and challenge problems
  - [x] Alternative scheduled connection time is **8-8:20AM Eastern** 

### Types of work
Your work will fall into three broad categories: coding, entry tickets, reflection
###### Coding: labs and challenge problems
All labs can be found [here](https://github.com/mrWallaceMadeira/Mod1Labs)\
To get started on a lab or challenge problem:
  - [x] Click on the folder that says `src/madeira/cs`
  - [x] Find the lab number that corresponds with the lab you're working on
  - [x] Copy and paste the code & comments into your IntelliJ file & start `coding`
###### Entry tickets
Entry tickets are **required** to attend class. They are provided as a link at the end of the associated lesson. 
###### Reflection
Reflections are done in response to our special topics days. These are written in your class OneNote notebook.

### Un-fun stuff: grading & cheating
 ###### Cheating
 This class should be fun and collaborative. **Do not** directly copy code from your classmates or the Interweb.  
 Still confused on cheating? It looks like [this](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/10/23/sports/YJPARMSTRONG1/YJPARMSTRONG1-superJumbo.jpg?quality=90&auto=webp)
 ###### Grading
